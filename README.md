# Project Description

This project implements a simple benefits eligibility checker using React and React Router DOM. The application features:

* Homepage: Introduces the checker and includes an age-input field.
* Success Page: Displayed to eligible users (18+ years old).
* Error Page: Displayed to ineligible users due to their input age..

# Prerequisites
Requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) to run. You can download and install it from the official [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) website.

# Installation
 * Clone or Download the Project: Get the project code from your repository.
 * Navigate to the Project Directory: Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the root of the project directory.
 * Install Dependencies: Install the required libraries using the following command:
    ```sh
    npm install react-router-dom
    ```

# Usage
* Run the Project:Start the development server, this will open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
    ```sh
    npm start
    ```
 * Enter your date of birth:  On the homepage, you'll find an input fields labeled "Day( DD)", "Month (MM)", "Year (YYYY)"

* Submit: Click the button to proceed with the age verification

Possible Outcomes:
* Eligible: If you are 18 years or older, you will be redirected to the success page.
* Not Eligible: If you do not meet the age requirement, you will be redirected to the error page.

#Tech Stack:

* React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces and creating single-page web applications. React's focus on components promotes a modular and reusable development approach.
* React Router DOM: A package specifically designed for routing within React applications on web browsers. It enables the dynamic creation of URL-driven navigation.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
